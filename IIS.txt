Basic instrunctions came from
https://gist.github.com/bparaj/ac8dd5c35a15a7633a268e668f4d2c94

but it didnt workf out of box, so I am uodating it with what issues I faced!
Assume IIS is installed. My machine already had IIs 8.5.

Install Python
==============

  1. Download web installer (Python 3.6.3).
  2. Run as Administrator.
  3. Select custom installation for all users.
  4. Choose install directory such that there are no white spaces in the path.
  Not sure if it needs to be done. Just being cautious.
  5. Check the box for "Add Python 3.6 to PATH".

Install wfastcgi and others
===========================

  1. Open Windows Powershell as Adminstrator.
  1.1 create virtual environment using
  python -m venv myappvenv
  1.2 activate virtual environment by Running
  ./myappvenv/Script/activate.ps1
  2. Run: pip install wfastcgi
  3. Run: pip install flask

Setting up Website
==================

  1. On the powershell, activate virtual environment and run:
    wfastcgi-enable
     It will produce configuration related output. Example:
     """
     Applied configuration changes to section "system.webserver/fastcgi" for
     "MACHINE/WEBROOT/APPHOST" at configuration commit path "MACHINE/WEBROOT/
     APPHOST"."c:\myappvenv\Scripts\python.exe|c:\myappvenv\Lib\site-packages\w
     fastcgi.py"
      can now be used as a FastCGI script processor.
     """

     make a note that this will work only if you run this in administrator
     consol of powershell. Without this
  1.1 create a folder for your website. e.g. myappsite, using administrator command line tool go
  to that folder and run following commands.
  icacls . /grant "NT AUTHORITY\IUSR:(OI)(CI)(RX)"
  icacls . /grant "Builtin\IIS_IUSRS:(OI)(CI)(RX)"

  again make a note that this will work only if you run this in administrator
  consol of powershell or cmd.
  2. Run IIS as administrator.
  3. Go to Connections and expand the tree.
  4. Select "Sites".
  5. Select "Add Website" under Actions panel on the right of the window.
  6. A new window will pop up titled "Add Website". Fill in the necessary info:
  Site name, Directory containing the website content, IP address and port (I
  entered 5000). Since I want to simply run it on local host, IP address can be
  left as "All unassigned".
  7. The Physical Path you specified in Add Website contains the following files
   (barebones):
    a. web.config: contains web configuration. It has the following content:
     """
     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
     <configuration>
     <system.webServer>
       <handlers>
        <clear/>
        <add name="Python FastCGI"
           path="*"
           verb="*"
           modules="FastCgiModule"
           scriptProcessor="c:\myappvenv\Scripts\python.exe|c:\myappvenv\Lib\site-packages\wfastcgi.py"

           resourceType="Unspecified"
           requireAccess="Script" />
       </handlers>
     </system.webServer>
     <appSettings>
       <!-- Required settings -->
       <add key="WSGI_HANDLER" value="myapp.app" />
       <add key="PYTHONPATH" value="C:\myappsite" />
     </appSettings>
     </configuration>
     """

     b. myapp.py: contains Flask applicatioh
     """
     from flask import Flask
     app = Flask(__name__)

     @app.route("/hello")
     def hello():
         return "Hello Stealth!"
     """

  8. You might have to restart the Server and the website after configuration changes. Option will be under Actions on the right.

  8. If you select the root node, you'll see a bunch of configuration features. We are interested in FastCGI Settings and Handler Mappings.
     a. Under FastCGI settings, I have the following:
        """
        Full Path                |          Arguments
        c:\python36\python.exe   |          c:\python36\lib\site-packages\wfastcgi.py
        c:\Program Files\PHP\php-cgi.exe
        """
     b. Under Handler Mappings, you'll see different names. Based on web.config, you'll see "Python FastCGI".

  10. You can now enter "localhost:5000" into the browser.
